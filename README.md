With the rise in e-commerce platforms, it is important for businesses to understand their customers well to analyze what they need and to improve their products. But to take better decisions there is a need to analyze the data and to do that manually is impossible. Our project will address this issue and help businesses to take better data-driven decisions to acknowledge the customers’ sentiments or opinions. This project will help businesses to quickly process and identify the customer interests, needs, feedback and the current trends. By doing this, they can improve their products, services, customer satisfaction and ultimately improve the revenue. Amazon is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, with millions of customers who buy and review products. Analyzing customer reviews can provide valuable insights for businesses to understand customer sentiments towards their products and services. Sentiment analysis is the process of automatically identifying the sentiment of text data, such as customer reviews.<br>

In this project, we performed sentiment analysis on Amazon customer reviews using SparkML. The dataset contained 883636 reviews and 5 classes, making it a multi-class classification problem. The objective of this project was to classify customer reviews into different sentiment categories, namely class 1, class 2, class 3, class 4, class 5. We used logistic regression as our classification algorithm. The approach we took involved cleaning the data by removing unnecessary words(stop words) and converting the text to lower-case. We also used a CountVectorizer to convert the text data into numerical form. We then split the data into training and testing sets, trained our model on 
the training set, and evaluated the performance on the testing set. Despite our efforts, the accuracy of our model was low, with a score of 56%. We believe that the imbalanced nature of the dataset and the lack of feature engineering may have contributed to the low accuracy. However, this project serves as a valuable learning experience in sentiment analysis and working with SparkML.<br>

## Approach: <br>
### Data/problem analysis: <br>
Before developing the sentiment analysis model with Spark ML, we conducted a problem statement and dataset analysis to guide our implementation. We conducted exploratory data analysis to better understand the dataset's features, such as the distribution of positive and negative reviews, the length of the reviews, and the most frequently used terms in the reviews. We also highlighted class imbalance as an important challenge in the dataset, with much more positive reviews (considering that the ratings were mostly 5) than negative reviews. We then reviewed several tools and resources for sentiment analysis, such as open-source libraries and cloud-based services, to find the appropriate solution for our problem. We ultimately chose Spark ML due to its scalability and ability to handle large datasets efficiently. SparkML has been used for building the sentiment analysis model. We have visualized the number of classes and their respective count using bar charts, pie charts to get a better understanding of the project. The pipeline for the model includes tokenizer, stopwords_remover, count_vectorizer, idf, and logistic regression. We also tried other algorithms like random forest 
and SVM to see if they could improve the accuracy of the model. In addition to these tools, the team(we) also referred to research papers on sentiment analysis using SparkML to gain insights into the best practices and techniques for implementing their model. Resources used: To support our solution, we used several external resources, including the SparkML library mentioned above. We also leveraged online resources such as tutorials and documentation to learn more about the different SparkML packages and how to use them effectively. In addition to Spark ML, we used various external resources to support our solution, including Python for programming, Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization, and pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis. External resources used include the research papers on sentiment analysis using SparkML.<br>

### Software Design:<br>
The software approach involves using SparkML to create a sentiment analysis model. Tokenization of reviews, removal of stopwords, vectorization of reviews, and logistic 
regression are all part of the model's workflow. Other methods, like random forest and SVM, have been tested as well. The model was trained using a dataset that was 350MB in size. For guidance, research publications on sentiment analysis using SparkML have been referred to. To tokenize and remove stop words from the reviews, the dataset was initially preprocessed with the Tokenizer and StopWordsRemover tools. The reviews were then converted into a bag-ofwords format using the CountVectorizer package, and the IDF software was used to weigh the value of each term in the review. Finally, the Logistic Regression software was used to train the model and predict each review's sentiment. We also tested other algorithms, such as Random Forest and SVM, to see how they are when compared to Logistic Regression. However, after balancing the dataset, Logistic Regression provided the highest accuracy of 56%. Overall, we used a thorough examination of the dataset, a survey of available resources, and careful selection and implementation of machine learning techniques to obtain the highest possible accuracy for sentiment analysis on Amazon customer reviews using SparkML.<br>

### The story of how the sentiment analysis model was built using SparkML involves the following steps:<br>
1. The dataset was loaded and preprocessed by tokenizing the reviews and removing stopwords.
2. The reviews were then vectorized using count vectorizer and inverse document frequency.
3. The sentiment analysis model was trained using logistic regression. Other algorithms such as random forest and SVM were also tried.
4. The accuracy of the model was evaluated and found to be 56% after balancing the dataset.
5. Research papers on sentiment analysis using SparkML were referred to for guidance throughout the implementation.<br>

To evaluate the performance of the models used, we have used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. We have used sparkML to achieve this(used the module MultiClassClassifier).<br>

### Below are the results achieved for the model:<br>
