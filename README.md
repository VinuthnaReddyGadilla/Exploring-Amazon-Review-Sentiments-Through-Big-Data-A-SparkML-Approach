With the rise in e-commerce platforms, it is important for businesses to understand their customers well to analyze what they need and to improve their products. But to take better decisions there is a need to analyze the data and to do that manually is impossible. Our project will address this issue and help businesses to take better data-driven decisions to acknowledge the customers’ sentiments or opinions. This project will help businesses to quickly process and identify the customer interests, needs, feedback and the current trends. By doing this, they can improve their products, services, customer satisfaction and ultimately improve the revenue. Amazon is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, with millions of customers who buy and review products. Analyzing customer reviews can provide valuable insights for businesses to understand customer sentiments towards their products and services. Sentiment analysis is the process of automatically identifying the sentiment of text data, such as customer reviews.<br>

In this project, we performed sentiment analysis on Amazon customer reviews using SparkML. The dataset contained 883636 reviews and 5 classes, making it a multi-class classification problem. The objective of this project was to classify customer reviews into different sentiment categories, namely class 1, class 2, class 3, class 4, class 5. We used logistic regression as our classification algorithm. The approach we took involved cleaning the data by removing unnecessary words(stop words) and converting the text to lower-case. We also used a CountVectorizer to convert the text data into numerical form. We then split the data into training and testing sets, trained our model on 
the training set, and evaluated the performance on the testing set. Despite our efforts, the accuracy of our model was low, with a score of 56%. We believe that the imbalanced nature of the dataset and the lack of feature engineering may have contributed to the low accuracy. However, this project serves as a valuable learning experience in sentiment analysis and working with SparkML.<br>

Tomas pranckevičius, Virginijus marcinkevičius(2017) have used a dataset of 2638274 reviews collected from Amazon to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. They have pre-processed the data using the techniques: tokenization, removing stop words, stemming with porter stemmer. They have used the Bag-of-Words approach to represent the text reviews as a set of features. The five algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression) have been implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python. The authors have used precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. The results of the study show that the Logistic Regression algorithm outperforms the other four algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1-score[1].Alexandros Baltas, Andreas Kanavos, Athanasios K. Tsakalidis(2017) have implemented a system on Apache Spark, an open-source framework for programming with Big Data. The sentiment analysis tool is based on Machine Learning methodologies alongside with Natural Language Processing techniques and utilizes Apache Spark’s Machine learning library, MLlib. In order to address the nature of Big Data, they introduced pre-processing steps for achieving better results in Sentiment Analysis. The classification algorithms are used for both binary and ternary classification, and the authors examined the effect of the dataset size as well as the features of the input on the quality of results. Finally, the proposed system was trained and validated with real data crawled by Twitter and in following results are compared with the ones from real users[2].Samar Al-Saqqaa, Ghazi Al-Naymata, Arafat Awajan(2018) have implemented a large-scale sentiment data classification approach for online reviews using Apache Spark. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Spark's MLlib package in classifying reviews. The authors collected a dataset of 2 million reviews from Amazon and preprocessed the data to create a bag-of-words model for feature extraction. They then trained and evaluated several machine learning algorithms, including naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and logistic regression, to identify the best-performing algorithm for sentiment classification. The results showed that SVM outperformed the other algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 86%. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using Spark's MLlib package for sentiment analysis of large-scale data and provides insights into the best practices for pre-processing and feature selection[3].Shuang Wang, Jian Luo, Liangfu Luo (2021) explain how Spark ML addresses these challenges by providing scalable and efficient tools for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training. The paper then describes the implementation of a multiclass classification model using 
Spark ML. The authors use the Amazon product review dataset, which consists of over 18,846 reviews categorized into five classes. They perform data preprocessing using Spark ML's built-in tools, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization. The authors also discuss various techniques for improving the performance of the classification model, such as feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. The authors used Spark ML's logistic regression algorithm to train the classification model. They evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The results show that Spark ML's logistic regression algorithm performs well in multiclass classification of large-scale text data[4].<br>

## Approach: <br>
### Data/problem analysis: <br>
Before developing the sentiment analysis model with Spark ML, we conducted a problem statement and dataset analysis to guide our implementation. We conducted exploratory data analysis to better understand the dataset's features, such as the distribution of positive and negative reviews, the length of the reviews, and the most frequently used terms in the reviews. We also highlighted class imbalance as an important challenge in the dataset, with much more positive reviews (considering that the ratings were mostly 5) than negative reviews. We then reviewed several tools and resources for sentiment analysis, such as open-source libraries and cloud-based services, to find the appropriate solution for our problem. We ultimately chose Spark ML due to its scalability and ability to handle large datasets efficiently. SparkML has been used for building the sentiment analysis model. We have visualized the number of classes and their respective count using bar charts, pie charts to get a better understanding of the project. The pipeline for the model includes tokenizer, stopwords_remover, count_vectorizer, idf, and logistic regression. We also tried other algorithms like random forest 
and SVM to see if they could improve the accuracy of the model. In addition to these tools, the team(we) also referred to research papers on sentiment analysis using SparkML to gain insights into the best practices and techniques for implementing their model. Resources used: To support our solution, we used several external resources, including the SparkML library mentioned above. We also leveraged online resources such as tutorials and documentation to learn more about the different SparkML packages and how to use them effectively. In addition to Spark ML, we used various external resources to support our solution, including Python for programming, Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization, and pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis. External resources used include the research papers on sentiment analysis using SparkML.<br>

### Software Design:<br>
The software approach involves using SparkML to create a sentiment analysis model. Tokenization of reviews, removal of stopwords, vectorization of reviews, and logistic 
regression are all part of the model's workflow. Other methods, like random forest and SVM, have been tested as well. The model was trained using a dataset that was 350MB in size. For guidance, research publications on sentiment analysis using SparkML have been referred to. To tokenize and remove stop words from the reviews, the dataset was initially preprocessed with the Tokenizer and StopWordsRemover tools. The reviews were then converted into a bag-ofwords format using the CountVectorizer package, and the IDF software was used to weigh the value of each term in the review. Finally, the Logistic Regression software was used to train the model and predict each review's sentiment. We also tested other algorithms, such as Random Forest and SVM, to see how they are when compared to Logistic Regression. However, after balancing the dataset, Logistic Regression provided the highest accuracy of 56%. Overall, we used a thorough examination of the dataset, a survey of available resources, and careful selection and implementation of machine learning techniques to obtain the highest possible accuracy for sentiment analysis on Amazon customer reviews using SparkML.<br>
